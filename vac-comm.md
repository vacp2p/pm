# [WIP] vac.comm aka waku/next

*This document is an early work in progress, and largely consists of notes that will be used to fill out a more thorough document such as [[WIP] Dagger: A Distributed Storage Network](https://hackmd.io/CDg3GXyTSbSmBQjL93hooA?both).*

## Overview

vac.comm provides private and decentralized communication.

Weâ€™re designing our network to tolerate higher than usual amounts of churn in anticipation of a large amount of mobile devices that we expect will make up the majority of the network.

A noteworthy aspect of this protocol is its focus on adding economic incentives as a method for scaling the network.

We take inspiration from various messaging protocols and borrow an overall modularity and extensibility design from IPFS and libp2p.

## Motivation and challenges

**Challenges being addressed:**
- scalability of the network
- incentived infrastructure and spam-resistance
- build with resource restricted devices in mind, including nodes being mostly offline

## System design, technical architecture and rationale

These are rough notes of things we currently know and don't know. They should be reformulated as a more coherent narrative.

**Relation between storage and communication:**
- We'll use the same building blocks (Nim, libp2p and many its more basic protocols, etc)
- We don't want to force a solution that fits for communication but not storage, and vice versa
- That said, we'll continuously look and strive for overlap between the two when it comes to routing, incentivization, etc

**On message routing:**
- Current Whisper-based routing fundamentally doesn't scale
- For structured approaches, Kademlia for full nodes is the leading candidate
- For unstructured approaches, gossipsub and episub are worth looking into more as complementary approaches

**On Kademlia routing:**
- This provides point to point and point to neighborhood capabilities
- Neighborhood routing is provided for with partial addressing a la PSS, and needs more experimental research to confirm feasibility
- As a fallback, an unstructured gossip mechanism can be used for neighborhood messaging

**On classical vs forwarding Kademlia:**
- Trade-off between classical and forwarding Kademlia: what's faster, opening new connections or re-using them?
- Classical Kademlia better studied, and also more tractable when it comes to who is doing the work
- We can likely provide both as options to keep flexibility, e.g. for heavy TCP forwarding might make more sense

**On incentivization:**
- Structured and more direct approaches like classical Kademlia more tractable in terms of who does what
- Incentivization in an unstructured routing setup a la gossip currently unproven
- More ideas need to be explored and falsified aggressively in this area, e.g. see Block.Science effort, Swarm postage stamps, etc

**On adaptive nodes:**
- Nodes with limited battery and short connection windows won't relay messages, and will instead likely rely on an emergent service network
- In this emergent service network, lighter nodes can have a simple cryptoeconomic game with fuller nodes in a simple request/response manner
- For semi-powered nodes, they can seamlessly join the DHT (e.g.) and provide some form of routing/storage

**On security, spam protection and availability:**
- S/Kademlia can be used as anextension with some form of registration cost
- Spam protection mechanisms needs further experimentation, e.g. stake based priority queue, postage stamps, zkSnarks rate limiting
- Node uptime assumptions and replication factors are fairly well-studied in Kademlia and can be leveraged statistically

**On privacy:**
- Transport privacy will be developed as a modular approach since not all use cases require it, and there are fundamental performance limitations
- With pseudoanonymity, spam protection and E2EE a lot of privacy guarantees are achieved over current state of things
- Offloading a lot of research to Nym et al, can also be complemented by making it easy to run over existing mixnet/Tor-like stacks, a la Briar

## Timeline and milestones

To be determined in more detail. Below is outlined what the most immediate next steps are for Waku, in addition to write-ups and general research work related to things above.

**On Waku/next and current approach:**
- Write an experimental Kademlia implementation for nim-libp2p, with the goal of (a) increasing tacit knowledge of Kademlia/libp2p/Nim and (b) acting as a base layer for upcoming applied research work
- Upcoming applied research work includes: Feasibility study of neighborhood routing; accounting and incentivization simulation for adaptive nodes; PoC for offline/storage interface; node capabilities and discovery beyond DNS
- Continue formulating a plan with timeline, priorities and milestones, both for vac.comm as well as in conjunction with vac.storage and in terms of supporting Core app needs
